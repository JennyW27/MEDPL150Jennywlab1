    <p>The first picture is about the increased protests and portrays them through the history of media innovations. From Newspapers to radio to TV to the Internet, which portrays protests and the right of speech. I want to use the Statue of Liberty as a base, with it holding a microphone to symbolize freedom of speech. I use blend modes such as Luminosity to change the Statue of Liberty with a blue background to fit the grayish background. Furthermore, I also use Transform such as Skew to present the Statue of Liberty at an angle that is presented as street art on a building. The layer masks would be shown in the panel from the screenshot. </p>
