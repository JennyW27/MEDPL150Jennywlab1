<p>My ultimate goal for my work is to portray a sense of escapism of life, memories, and beauty through photography, collage, video, and editing that present culture, personality, and dreams. I capture moments through photography, editing, and filters with Canva and different editing software. Currently, focusing on exploring various styles, aesthetics, culture, image composition, and skill sets of photography and editing from creators and other inspirations. I used a personal Instagram account to test, grow, and learn these skill sets to build my niche and aesthetic. This way of practicing exposes me to various creations and genres, enriching my understanding of art, my skills, and toolkit. As a result, it encourages me to brainstorm, analyze trends, and craft a story to build engaging posts and videos. With experience in producing pictures and videos for my community church to share messages to uplift, connect, and guide the community with the use of Canva. Through exploring the community’s habits, interests, and culture, to storytell through posts and videos to build connections. I truly believe photography has the power to share personal stories as well as present others’ stories to encourage, to admire, to advise, and to be learned from. Photography could be provided as a service to capture memories of loved ones, one’s beauty, one’s story, and to advertise products. I would love to offer this type of service with the skills I obtain through the lab session, including the beginning of coding, web building, producing skill set, and basic editing skills. </p>
