<h1>Reflections</h1>
<p>"In Plato’s Cave” chapter 1 from On Photography by Susan Sontag
<br>
I’m interested in landscape photography that focuses on nature, architecture, and objects.  I am interested in the relationship of the world through the lens. I want to use photography to find tranquility within the chaos, especially in the city where everyone is busy and rushing. My photography focuses on the flowers, corners, and places within the city, interacting between people, space, and light. With the advancement of modern technology, people spend less time looking around, being curious, or meditating. I want my work to reflect life and encourage people to slow down and to enjoy the moment, to forget stress, overthinking thoughts, and plans, to pause, admire, and reflect. Currently, I couldn’t explain a deep topic through photography due to my lack of exploration, skills, and experience. I do hope I could use this power to empower smaller groups of people that need a voice, where I was inspired by others who found ways of using this power like news media, social media, and advertising, for smaller groups. However, I believe not every art, photography, and film should be limited to only advocating and educating. The genres should be various, and I want to focus on the small joys in life, where they are often overlooked and not given credit to keep us steady on the race that is called life.</br>

Some eye-opening acknowledgment about photography that has reshaped my perspective through the reading was the tension between actuality and manipulated truth in photography. Although photography portrays a realistic image, they are often influenced by the photographer’s bias and style. Oftentimes, we see photography used to portray realism, whereas on the other hand, these images of our world could be very likely staged. Since the advance of photography, such as filters and color grading, many have used these skills to blur the line of realism and create a fantasy distinct from our world, whereas painting used to try to achieve and portray realism. Examples such as tourist trap photo, where editing is heavy on color grading to advertise and romanticize the traveling location as a dream location to travel. However, the reality is that the location is far from the Instagram-worthy pictures. Furthermore, each artist has a personal style and a way of portraying the world, which means each person sees the truth in various perspectives, so their art should not be seen as the entire truth but as a creative point of view that could touch the heart and be related. This further leads to my question: Would it be possible to focus on realism without the influence of an artist’s style? If so, how could it be done? Another point that touches my heart from the reading is that photography could be a type of art where the line between normal people and artists is blurred because anyone with a camera can take pictures; however, only under certain situations, the skills of a photographer could benefit those who don't possess the skills. It could lead Photography to be an underestimated art where phones make cameras more accessible.</br>
